## Prerequisites

Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) before proceeding. This will ensure you have the necessary tools to run React Native apps on your system, such as Node.js, Watchman, Android Studio (for Android development), and Xcode (for iOS development).

## Dependencies

- **Node.js** (>= 14.0.0)
- **Yarn** (optional)
- **React Native CLI** (via `npm` or `yarn`)

3. Install the required CocoaPods dependencies (for iOS):
